        <mark>Title : Comparative Analysis of various Modulation Schemes in AWGN and Rayleigh Fading Channels in 5G NR</mark>
        </pre>
        <p><mark>Our project aims to comprehensively analyze various modulation schemes, including BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM, within the framework of 5G NR. Utilizing MATLAB simulations, we evaluate these schemes based on their Bit Error Rate (BER) across different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. The study encompasses two critical channel conditions: the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel and the Rayleigh Fading channel. By comparing the performance of these modulation schemes under varying SNR levels and channel conditions, we aim to provide insights into their suitability for 5G communication systems, facilitating informed decision-making in network design and optimization.
